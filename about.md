**TwoTone** lets you turn data into sound and music. It uses the process of [sonification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonification "Sonification") to let you hear data. It’s free and open source and runs 100% on the web, so you don’t need to download anything. TwoTone works on desktops, tablets and phones. It’s designed to be fast, fun and easy to use. TwoTone is imagined and made by [Datavized Technologies](https://datavized.com) with support from [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/ "Google News Initiative").

This is the second tool in Datavized's collaboration with Google. The first, [Morph](https://morph.graphics/ "Morph"), lets you make art from data. Both projects were commissioned by [Simon Rogers](https://simonrogers.net/) at Google, and the development process was mentored by advisor [Alberto Cairo](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/).

## What is TwoTone for?

There are two areas where TwoTone adds value:

1. **Understanding Data** - Music is math. TwoTone uses a technique called "sonification". This just means that it turns data into sound. We didn’t invent this concept, it’s been around for a while already. Our intention is to make it more accessible as a web app. If understanding the data is your goal, you may want to keep things simple and resist the urge to make too many layers or add too many effects.
2. **Making Music** - Get creative. TwoTone is a fun and intuitive way to make your own compositions, without any prior musical or technical knowledge. The algorithm makes an audio track from one column of your data automatically and you can change the instrument, add more columns, and experiment from there until you have made something that interests you. Music you make can be exported for use in creative projects.

## Advantages

1. **Data** - Turning data into sound has advantages. Just like in the cinema, sound adds another layer to understanding. Sound does not require you to look at a screen. You could be anywhere in a room and hear the differences in the output. It can be used by itself or as a complement to visual systems. The representation of the data is as "true" as a visual rendering and any anomalies can be heard, identified and acted upon. It also has potential uses for people who are visually impaired.
2. **Music** - Being able to make your own music is empowering. Here at the Datavized office, we’re listening to things we’ve made ourselves and they sound pretty good. Good enough to be used as background music for a podcast or video or whatever else could be made more interesting with an original soundtrack. It’s great to add a new thing to your skill set. And talented musicians and composers who have used it love it too because it adds a randomness that sparks new ideas.
