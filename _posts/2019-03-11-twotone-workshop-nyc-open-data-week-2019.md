Watch this workshop video to learn about how to use TwoTone to sonify NYC Open Data.  As an official partner of NYC Open Data Week 2019, Datavized organized a TwoTone launch event on March 5, 2019. The public event featured an introduction from the Mayor's Office of Data Analytics and demo of the [NYC Open Data Portal](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/how-to/ "Getting Started with Open Data") and a demo of TwoTone using a [sample data set built into the tool](https://twotone.io/tutorials/introduction-to-twotone/ "Introduction to TwoTone") (Honey Production in the USA) and sample data set from the NYC Open Data portal ([NYC 311 Rodents Complaints from 2010 to Present](https://twotone.io/examples/nyc-311-rodent-complaints/ "NYC 311 Rodent Complaints")). We also present a walkthrough of the [Basque Country EUSTAT example](https://twotone.io/examples/song-of-the-day-basque-country-eustat/ "Basque Country EUSTAT example")"Song Of The Day"using behavioral survey data collected in 2013 to build a time-based sonification story.
