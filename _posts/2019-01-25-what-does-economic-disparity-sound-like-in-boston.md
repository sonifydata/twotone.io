Datavized and the City of Boston Mayors Office of New Urban Mechanics (MONUM) teamed up to explore how TwoTone could be used as a civic exploration tool to uncover sounds of economic disparity throughout the City. Using 311 data from City of Boston's open data portal Analyze Boston, the team filtered data based on the year and the City's response to complains by neighborhood. This data set was imported into TwoTone and filtered further using the advanced features. The resulting audio experiment led MONUM to detect new anomolies and insights not previously understood through charts and graphs. Learn more below about this project and how the MONUM team used TwoTone as an exploration tool. Sample audio tracks, video recordings and shared insights are below.
