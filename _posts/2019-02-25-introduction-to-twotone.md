Watch this introduction tutorial video to learn about how to get started using TwoTone. This walkthrough will show you the simple steps to get started with TwoTone so you'll be quickly on your way to creating your first data sonification.

This tutorial uses the sample data set Honey Production in the USA (1998-2012), there are also several other spreadsheets built into the app to get you started and a handy tour built into the app.
