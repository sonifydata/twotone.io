Watch this video tutorial to learn how to use advanced feature in TwoTone.  We use the Basque Country EUSTAT 'Song of the Day' example to walk you through how it was made. 

To replicate or remix the project, you can watch the tutorial and then download the 'Use of Time' data set [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iKZqutJcmyz1QkxC1gOzyqY9t7K6elb4 "Use of Time data set ") or go to the source link [here](http://en.eustat.eus/elementos/ele0000400/Average_social_time_per_participant_and_rate_type_of_physiological_need_day_of_the_week_and_province_hhmm/tbl0000453_i.html "Basque Country EUSTAT 'Use of Time'").
