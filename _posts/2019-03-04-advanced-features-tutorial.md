Watch this video tutorial to learn how to use advanced features in TwoTone.  We use the Basque Country EUSTAT 'Song of the Day' example to walk you through how it was made.

To replicate or remix the project, you can watch the tutorial and then download the 'Use of Time' data set [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iKZqutJcmyz1QkxC1gOzyqY9t7K6elb4 "Use of Time data set ") or go to the source link [here](http://en.eustat.eus/elementos/ele0000400/Average_social_time_per_participant_and_rate_type_of_physiological_need_day_of_the_week_and_province_hhmm/tbl0000453_i.html "Basque Country EUSTAT 'Use of Time'").

# MIDI Out Feature

In 2022, we have added the much requested feature - MIDI Out support! This is an experimental addition which allows TwoTone to behave more like a music sequencer, for controlling synthesisers and more using the good old standard \[MIDI\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI")). We are currently inviting users to test the new feature. 

If you would like to sign up to test on your setup, please reach out using the form below the video preview.
