 ~~the twotone.io site builds from published posts pushed by foresty.io CMS~~

## UPDATE: 22 July 2024

Forestry.io no longer exists. Porting to Tina. 
Whilst still a jekyll site...

```npx tinacms dev -c "jekyll serve"```

Ruby might be broken... things to try
```bundle update --bundler```

```eval "$(rbenv init -)"```

``` source ~/.bash_profile ```

then try the command again

at this point admin will hopefully be 
```http://localhost:4000/admin/index.html```
and site
```http://127.0.0.1:4000```
