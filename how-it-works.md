## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get started with TwoTone.

1. **Audio Track** - TwoTone will automatically generate an audio track from your data set. You can change your track's data source or instrument.
2. **Play Audio** - Click the Play button to hear the sound generated from your data.
3. **Speak Title** - Enter a Title to automatically generate text-to-speech, toggle to turn speech on or off. Customize settings for language, gender and voice options.
4. **Add Audio Track** - Generate another audio track automatically from your data set or upload an audio track of your own.
5. **Adjust Duration** - Adjust your total duration, row duration, and tempo (BPM) to speed up or slow down your composition.
6. **Advanced Features** - Adjust the volume of your audio track, filter it by data columns or by value, change the key of your musical scale, or adjust octave, scale range and tempo to create an arpeggio.
7. **Export Audio** - Export your project to an audio file in MP3 or Waveform (PCM) format. MP3 Bit Rate export options are 64 kbps, 128 kbps,, 192 kbps, and 320 kbps.

There is also a guided tour built into the web app.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What devices does TwoTone run on?

If you want to export your music using an Apple device, please use a Desktop or Laptop computer. TwoTone works on mobile on Android. Due to restrictions with Safari, iOS users can make and listen to their compositions but can't export them to their device. If this changes in the future we will enable the feature.

### What kind of data can I use?

TwoTone will accept spreadsheet files up to 20MB in size and 2,000 rows of data. Formats supported are: .xls, .xlsx, .csv, .ods. Drag and drop files into the browser window. Remember that your output will only be as good as your input, so please take time to check your spreadsheet for errors or unnecessary text fields. Also make sure that you are uploading an actual spreadsheet and not a PDF since a PDF will not be readable.

### Does TwoTone store my data?

The data uploaded to TwoTone is processed fully in the web browser: no server-side operations or storage is performed. 

### Where do I find data online?

Organizations like the United Nations have a lot of publicly available data as well as most large cities: for example, try the the [NYC Open Data portal](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/). You can search these listings, and if you find something you like make sure the size works or edit it down if needed. 

TwoTone also has some sample data sets built in to help get you started.

### How can your organization benefit from using TwoTone?

TwoTone is designed to be seamlessly integrated into the workflow of a newsroom and used either as a standalone tool for publishing sonification on the web or as a soundtrack builder for multimedia projects. The tool is customizable to enable creators to map any data input to the desired audio output.

### How does Text-to-Speech work?

Twotone uses Google’s Text-To-Speech API so that a creator can type a title for their piece and have it read in a male or female voice in different languages. This audio is placed before the music starts to give context to the listener. You can turn it on or off. Technically, this means that Twotone can’t really be described purely as 'sonification' since that word refers to "the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data".
