Follow these simple steps to get started with TwoTone.

{% include toc.html %}

TwoTone lets you make music from data. It's free and open source and runs 100% on the web, so you don't need to download anything. TwoTone works on desktops, tablets and phones. It's designed to be fast, fun and easy to use. TwoTone has been developed by Datavized Technologies with support from Google News Initiative.

You can get started at [app.twotone.io](//app.twotone.io "app.twotone.io") + or view it on [github](https://github.com/datavized/twotone "TwoTone").

This is the second tool in Datavized's collaboration with Google. The first, [Morph](https://morph.graphics/ "Morph"), lets you make art from data. [Get it here](https://app.morph.graphics/ "Morph").

## What is TwoTone for?

There are two areas where TwoTone adds value:

1. Understanding Data

Music is math. TwoTone uses a technique called "sonification". This just means that it turns data into sound. We didn't invent this concept, it's been around for a while already. Our intention is to make it more accessible as a web app. If understanding the data is your goal, you may want to keep things simple and resist the urge to make too many layers or add too many effects.

1. Making Music

Get creative. TwoTone is a fun and intuitive way to make your own compositions, without any prior musical or technical knowledge. The algorithm makes an audio track from one column of your data automatically and you can change the instrument, add more columns, and experiment from there until you have made something that interests you. Music you make can be exported for use in a project or shared by itself to social media.

## Advantages

1. **Data**  - Turning data into sound has advantages. Just like in the cinema, sound adds another layer to understanding. Sound does not require you to look at a screen. You could be anywhere in a room and hear the differences in the output. It can be used by itself or as a complement to visual systems. The representation of the data is as “true” as a visual rendering and any anomalies can be heard, identified and acted upon. It also has potential uses for people who are visually impaired.
2. **Music** - Being able to make your own music is empowering. Here at the Datavized office, we're listening to things we've made ourselves and they sound pretty good. Good enough to be used as background music for a podcast or video or whatever else could be made more interesting with an original soundtrack. It's great to add a new thing to your skill set. And talented musicians and composers who have used it love it too because it adds a randomness that sparks new ideas.

## What kind of data can I use?

There is no limit to the kind of data that can be uploaded but remember that your output will only be as good as your input, so please take time to check your spreadsheet for errors.

The data uploaded to TwoTone is processed fully in the web browser: no server-side operations or storage is performed.

## How can your organization benefit from using TwoTone?

TwoTone is designed to be seamlessly integrated into the workflow of a newsroom and used either as a standalone tool for publishing sonification on the web or as a soundtrack builder for multimedia projects.

The tool is fully customizable to enable creators to map any data input to the desired audio output.

## How does it work?

1. **Audio Track** - TwoTone will automatically generate an audio track from your data set. You can change your track's data source or instrument.
2. **Play Audio** - Click the Play button to hear the sound generated from your data.
3. **Speak Title** - Enter a Title to automatically generate text-to-speech, toggle to turn speech on or off. Customize settings for language, gender and voice options.
4. **Add Audio Track** - Generate another audio track automatically from your data set or upload an audio track of your own.
5. **Adjust Duration** - Adjust your total duration, row duration, and tempo (BPM) to speed up or slow down your composition.
6. **Advanced Features** - Adjust the volume of your audio track, filter it by data columns or by value, change the key of your musical scale, or adjust octave, scale range and tempo to create an arpeggio.
7. **Export Audio** - Export your project to an audio file in MP3 or Waveform (PCM) format. MP3 Bit Rate export options are 64 kbps, 128 kbps,, 192 kbps, and 320 kbps.
