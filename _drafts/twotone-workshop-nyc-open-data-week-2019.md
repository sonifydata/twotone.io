excerpt: Learn how to use TwoTone with NYC Open Data

---
Watch this workshop video to learn about how to use TwoTone to sonify NYC Open Data. As an official partner of NYC Open Data Week 2019, Datavized organized a TwoTone launch event on March 5, 2019 at Parsons School of Design.  The public event 'Datavized Workshop: Learn how to use NYC Open Data with TwoTone and Geometric' featured an introduction from the Mayor's Office of Data Analytics and demo of the NYC Open Data Portal and a demo of TwoTone using a sample data set built into the tool (Honey Production in the USA) and sample data set from the NYC Open Data portal (NYC 311 Rodent complaints).

To explore this example in more depth, visit our Example page.
